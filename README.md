# Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks

Code for training a CGCNN model to predict material properties of crystals.

##  Prerequisites

This package requires:

- [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [pymatgen](http://pymatgen.org)

You can test if all the prerequisites are installed properly by running:

```bash
python main.py -h
python predict.py -h
```

This should display the help messages for `main.py` and `predict.py`. If you find no error messages, it means that the prerequisites are installed properly.

## Usage

There are two examples of customized datasets in the repository: `data/sample-regression` for regression and `data/sample-classification` for classification. 

### Train a CGCNN model

Before training a new CGCNN model, you will need to:

- [Define a customized dataset](#define-a-customized-dataset) at `root_dir` to store the structure-property relations of interest.

Then, in directory `cgcnn`, you can train a CGCNN model for your customized dataset by:

```bash
python main.py root_dir
```

You can set the number of training, validation, and test data with labels `--train-size`, `--val-size`, and `--test-size`. Alternatively, you may use the flags `--train-ratio`, `--val-ratio`, `--test-ratio` instead. Note that the ratio flags cannot be used with the size flags simultaneously. For instance, `data/sample-regression` has 10 data points in total. You can train a model by:

```bash
python main.py --train-size 6 --val-size 2 --test-size 2 data/sample-regression
```
or 
```bash
python main.py --train-ratio 0.6 --val-ratio 0.2 --test-ratio 0.2 data/sample-regression
```

You can also train a classification model with label `--task classification`. For instance, you can use `data/sample-classification` by:

```bash
python main.py --task classification --train-size 5 --val-size 2 --test-size 3 data/sample-classification
```

After training, you will get three files in `cgcnn` directory.

- `model_best.pth.tar`: stores the CGCNN model with the best validation accuracy.
- `checkpoint.pth.tar`: stores the CGCNN model at the last epoch.
- `test_results.csv`: stores the `ID`, target value, and predicted value for each crystal in test set.

## Data

You can download the corresponding datasets following the [instruction](data/material-data).
